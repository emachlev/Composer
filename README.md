# Genetic Composer

*"Composition consists in two things only. The first is the ordering and disposing of several sounds...in such a manner that their succession pleases the ear. This is what the Ancients called melody. The second is the rendering audible of two or more simultaneous sounds in such a manner that their combination is pleasant. This is what we call harmony, and it alone merits the name of composition."*

- All compositions "exist", we just need to find them.
- A mere 10 note melody will produce over 75 billion potential melodies of 13 notes within a piano octave.

This (WIP) algorithm generates short, random piano melodies, and based on user feedback improves its output.
